# EnneaticPoliticalCompass
A new and improved political self-test which places you on a 2d graph, where x is economic power, and y is political power.  It is divided into 9 enneants, opposed to the 4 quadrants method utilized by the original political compass.  This test also achieves placement a bit differently.
